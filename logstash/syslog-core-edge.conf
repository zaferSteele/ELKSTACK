# This Logstash configuration file is designed
# to ingest syslog messages from two different 
# types of network devices: core and edge.
#
# - It listens on two separate UDP ports:
#   - Port 5144 for core devices (tagged "syslog-core")
#   - Port 5145 for edge devices (tagged "syslog-edge")
#
# - For edge device logs, it adds a timestamp field.
#
# - The logs are output in two ways:
#   - Printed to the console in JSON format
#   - Sent to an Elasticsearch cluster over HTTPS
#     with optional SSL certificate verification
#
# - The Elasticsearch index names are based on the 
#   log type and the date (e.g., syslog-core-2025.07.09)

  # First UDP input: listens on port 5144 for syslog messages from core devices
  udp {
    port => 5144  # Port Logstash will listen on for incoming syslog messages
    type => "syslog-core"  # Tag these events with "syslog-core" for filtering and indexing later
  }

  # Second UDP input: listens on port 5145 for syslog messages from edge devices
  udp {
    port => 5145  # A different port for a different device type
    type => "syslog-edge"  # Tag these events with "syslog-edge"
  }
}

filter {
  # Only apply this filter if the event type is "syslog-edge"
  if [type] == "syslog-edge" {
    grok {
      # This grok pattern matches all messages but doesn't actually parse anything.
      # It's a placeholder (".*" means match everything).
      match => { "message" => ".*" }

      # Add a new field called "received_at" with the timestamp when the event was received
      add_field => [ "received_at", "%{@timestamp}" ]

  elasticsearch {
    # Elasticsearch host and port (make sure this IP is reachable from Logstash)
    hosts => ["https://<Elasticsearch_host_ip_address:port_number>"]

    # Use SSL/TLS for secure communication with Elasticsearch
    ssl => true

    # Do not verify SSL certificates
    ssl_certificate_verification => false

    # Authentication credentials to connect to Elasticsearch
    user => "elastic"
    password => "<password>"  # Replace with your actual password

    # Define the index naming pattern in Elasticsearch
    # The %{type} part uses the event's type (e.g., syslog-core or syslog-edge)
    # The %{+YYYY.MM.dd} part adds the current date to the index name
    # Example: syslog-core-2025.07.09 or syslog-edge-2025.07.09
    index => "%{type}-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
